				<h1>About Ramazon...</h1>
				<p className="center">I honestly did not expect anyone to read this page but here you are</p>
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				<h2>The Elevator Pitch</h2>
				<p>Ramazon is just an app that allows you to buy something random from amazon. A glorified dice shaker if you will</p>
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				<h2>Developers</h2>
				<h5>Michael Sorensen</h5>
				I am a full stack web developer. I created this website application using the following technologies: React, Webpack, SQL, Node (with a dash of ES6).
				My current full time job is Tech Support at Daybreak games which I absolutely love since I love video games. Freelance projects like Ramazon
				allow me to stay fresh with my software development skills.
				<h5>Alex Escobedo</h5>

				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<h5>Q: Is this a scam? </h5>
				<p>A: believe it or not Ramazon is not in fact a scam since a scam involves some sort of deceipt. We try to be as transparent as possible to convey 
				exactly how stupid this all is </p>
				<h5>Q: Okay, then how do you make money?</h5>
				<p>A:  We scrape a small percentage off the top off each transaction. So we don't make much and it depends on where you are located. In Louisiana 
				we don't make as much since your sales tax rate is so damn high</p>
				<h5>Q: Hallo, I live in &lt;some random ass country outside of the US&gt; can I use ramazon?</h5>
				<p>No</p>
				<h5>Q: What are your goals with this project?</h5>
				<p>A: Yeah, we want the project to be successful obviously. To do that we'll need to use social media to brain wash people into thinking that this is a
				trendy thing to do. Then we might be able to expand to let people gain points by tagging items on the browse section and then spend those points
				to actually purchase real goods. That will be later down the pipeline<i>#hailCorporate</i></p>
